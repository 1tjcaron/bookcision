By coincidence, the soup of the day was green pea soup, as if in honor of Aomame. The dowager had a glass of Chablis, and Aomame kept her company. The wine was just as elegant and simple as the food. Aomame ordered a grilled cut of white fish. The dowager took only vegetables. Her manner of eating the vegetables was beautiful, like a work of art.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=2864">Location: 2864</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">“When</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=2867">Location: 2867</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">Vegetarian dishes were central to the meals she prepared for herself, to which she added seafood, mostly white fish. An occasional piece of chicken was about all the meat she would eat. She chose only fresh ingredients and kept seasonings to a minimum, rejecting high-fat ingredients entirely and keeping her intake of carbohydrates low. Salads she would eat with a touch of olive oil, salt, and lemon juice, never dressings. She did not just eat a lot of vegetables, she also studied their nutritional elements in detail and made sure she was eating a well-balanced selection. She fashioned her own original menus and shared them with sports club members when asked. “Forget about counting calories,” she would always advise them. “Once you develop a knack for choosing the proper ingredients and eating in moderation, you don’t have to pay attention to numbers.” This is not to say that she clung obsessively to her ascetic menus. If she felt a strong desire for meat, she would pop into a restaurant and order a thick steak or lamb chops.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=3901">Location: 3901</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">Aomame hung up and finished stir-frying her vegetables. Then she made some miso soup with bean sprouts and had that with brown rice.

Not much of a match for a red wine, but it’s free, so I can’t complain.” “Mind sharing a little?” “Not at all,” Aomame said. “And if you don’t mind, let’s share the deep-fried shrimp to start.”</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=4045">Location: 4045</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">The dowager and Aomame both tasted the wine. It had a lovely bouquet and was perfectly chilled. The dinner consisted of boiled white asparagus, salade Niçoise, a crabmeat omelet, and rolls and butter, nothing more. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious, and the portions were moderate.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=4618">Location: 4618</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">The two were sharing a light meal and a bottle of Chianti at a small, late-night Italian restaurant in Iikura, a quiet neighborhood. Aomame was having a salad with strips of raw tuna, while Ayumi had ordered a plate of gnocchi with basil sauce.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=6166">Location: 6166</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">Tengo walked to the station and bought a paper at the newsstand.

We at the company have been unable to determine whether her current disappearance might have something to do with her attitude toward such matters. While young, Miss Fukada is an author with abundant talent from whom much can be expected in the future. We hope that she reappears in good health as soon as possible.”</p><p class="bookcision-highlight-note">Testing a highlight WITH a note.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=6976">Location: 6976</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">nice, quiet place where we can talk without interruption.” He surveyed the reception room as though appraising its value. There was nothing special about the room. It had one big oil painting hanging on the wall—a picture of some mountain, more impressive for the weight of its paint than anything else. A vase had an arrangement of flowers resembling dahlias—dull blossoms reminiscent of a slow-witted matron.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=7043">Location: 7043</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-note-context">a bull,” Ushikawa said, smiling.

Then he went to a restaurant in the station and ordered rice and curry and a salad. He killed time after the meal by drinking a cup of thin coffee.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=8458">Location: 8458</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">Tengo washed the rice, put it in the cooker, and turned on the switch. He used the time until the rice was ready to make miso soup with wakame seaweed and green onions, grill a sun-dried mackerel, take some tofu out of the refrigerator and flavor it with ginger, grate a chunk of daikon radish, and reheat some leftover boiled vegetables. To go with the rice, he set out some pickled turnip slices and a few pickled plums.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=9643">Location: 9643</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">The FM radio was playing a Marcel Dupré organ piece.

He would get up early, take a walk along the shore, watch the fishing boats go in and out of the harbor, then return to the inn for breakfast. Breakfast was exactly the same every day—dried horse mackerel and fried eggs, a quartered tomato, seasoned dried seaweed, miso soup with shijimi clams, and rice—but for some reason it tasted wonderful every morning. After breakfast he would sit at a small desk and write.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=13041">Location: 13041</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">“Years ago I used to hit my old lady all the time, so I’m not one to talk.” He opened his mouth, showing off his missing teeth, and guffawed, as if hitting your wife every once in a while were one of life’s notable pleasures.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=13275">Location: 13275</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight with-note">Blurring the line between possible and impossible,</p><p class="bookcision-highlight-note">blurring test note</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004LROUW2&amp;location=19489">Location: 19489</a></p></li></ul></div>
