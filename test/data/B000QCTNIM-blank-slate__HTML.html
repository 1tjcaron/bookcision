Many of these tradeoffs, I will show, arise from features of human nature, and by clarifying them I hope to make our collective choices, whatever they are, better informed. If I am an advocate, it is for discoveries about human nature that have been ignored or suppressed in modern discussions of human affairs.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000QCTNIM&location=171">Location: 171</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">One trend is a stated contempt among many scholars for the concepts of truth, logic, and evidence. Another is a hypocritical divide between what intellectuals say in public and what they really believe. A third is the inevitable reaction: a culture of “politically incorrect” shock jocks who revel in anti-intellectualism and bigotry, emboldened by the knowledge that the intellectual establishment has forfeited claims to credibility in the eyes of the public.</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000QCTNIM&location=202">Location: 202</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight without-note">ultimately people crave sex in order to reproduce (because the ultimate cause of sex is reproduction), but proximately they may do everything they can not to reproduce (because the proximate cause of sex is pleasure).</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000QCTNIM&location=1423">Location: 1423</a></p></li><li><p class="bookcision-highlight-note">RFT adds methodological and conceptual precision to this idea</p><p class="bookcision-location"><a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000QCTNIM&location=1543">Location: 1543</a></p></li></ul></div>
